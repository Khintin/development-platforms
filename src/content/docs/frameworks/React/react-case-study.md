## Introduction

**React** (also known as _React.js_ or _Reactjs_) is a javascript library for building dynamic and interactive user interfaces. It was created at facebook in 2011, and it was currently the most widely used Javascript library for front end development.

## Brief History

React was created by **Jordan Walke**, a software engineer at Meta, who realesed an early prototype of React called _FaxJS_:

-   2011: It was first deployed on Facebook's newsfeed.
-   2012: Deployed on Instagram
-   May 2013: _The initial public release of React_ used the Apache License 2.0.
-   October 2014: React 0.12.00 replaced this with the \*3-clause BSD license\*\* and added a separate PATENTS text file that permits usage of any Facebook patents related to the software.
-   Febuary 2015: **React Native**, which enables native Android, iOS and UWP development with React, was announced at Facebook's React Conf.
-   March 2016: React Native public release.
-   April 18, 2017: Facebook announced **React Fiber**, a new set of internal algotithms for rendering, as opposed to React's old rendering algorithm, Stack.
-   September 26, 2017: _React 16.0_ was released to the public.
-   August 10, 2020: the React team announced the first release candidate for _React v17.0_, notable as the first major release without changes to the React developer-facing API.
-   March 29, 2022: React 18 was released which introduced a new concurrent renderer, automatic batching and support for server side rendering with suspense.

## Main Features

React is an open-source and component-based front-end library developed by Facebook for creating dynamic and interactive applications and building better UI/UX design for web and mobile applications.

**The Major Features of React**

-   **JSX(JavaScript Syntax Extension):** JSX is a combination of HTML and JavaScript. You can embed JavaScript objects inside the HTML elements. JSX makes codes easy and understandble.
-   **Virtual DOM:** React uses virtual DOM which is an exact copy of the real DOM. Whenever there is a modification in the web application, the whole virtual DOM is updated first and finds the difference between real DOM and Virtual DOM. Once it finds the difference, then DOM updates only the part that has changed recently and everything remains the same.
-   **One-way data binding:** The data in react flows only in one direction i.e. from parent components to child components. The properties (props). in the child component cannot return the data to its parent according to the provided inputs.
-   **Performance:** React uses virtual DOM and updates only the modified parts, which makes it faster than the other JavaScript frameworks.
-   **Extensions:** React has many extentions that we can use to create full-fledged UI applications. It supports mobile app development and provides server-side rendering. React is extended with Flux, Redux, React Native, etc., which helps us to create good-looking UI.
-   **Conditional Statements:** JSX allows us to write conditional statements. The data in the browser is displayed according to the conditions provided inside the JSX.
-   **Components** React adheres to the declarative programming paradigm, where developers design views for each state of an application, and React updates and renders components when data changes.

## Market Comparison

React is one of the most popular front-end libraries used for building dynamic and interactive applications. According to a survey conducted in 2023, Node.js overtook React.js to become the most used web framework among software developers worldwide. However, React still holds a significant market share of **4.1%** among all websites that use JavaScript libraries.

| **Architecture**   | React is a library that focuses on the _view layer_ of an application.                                                                                                                    | Angular is a _full-fledged framework_ that provides a complete solution for building web applications.                                         |
| **Language**       | React uses JavaScript                                                                                                                                                                     | Angular uses Typescript                                                                                                                        |
| **DOM**            | React uses _Virtual DOM_, which is an in-memory representation of the real DOM.                                                                                                           | Angular uses _Real DOM_, which is a tree-like structure of HTML elements                                                                       |
| **Data Binding**   | React uses _one-way data binding_, which means that data flows only in one direction, from parent components to child components.                                                         | Angular uses _two-waydata binding_, which means that data flows in both directions, from parent components to child components and vice versa. |
| **Performance**    | React is faster than Angular because it uses Virtual DOM, which updates only the modified parts of the web application                                                                    | Angular updates the whole Real DOM every time there is a change in the application.                                                            |
| **Learning Curve** | React has a relatively low learning curve compared to Angular because it is just a library and not a full-fledged framework. However, it requires knowledge of JavaScript and JSX syntax. |

| **Community Support** | Both React and Angular have a large communities that provide support and resources for developers. However, React has more third-party libraries and tools available than Angular.|
